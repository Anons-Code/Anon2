<td>Anon is an anonymous digital world. 
Originally born as a simple message board, Anon has grown and 
developed into a powerhouse of anonymity. All aspects of Anonymous 
World are seperate, anonymous, and distinct entities, guaranteeing 
super anonymity. The live chat, message board, and MMORPG world 
all use seperate and distinct anonymous profiles to guarantee 
your privacy and security.</td>
<td>There are many ways of guaranteeing anonymity. All 
 posts are limited in scope and automatically deleted with time. 
 Before they can become too popular, they are destroyed. Whether 
 after five views, ten views, or a hundred views, you set your 
 view limit, and the post is destroyed. In the anonymous online 
 game, each login creates a new, anonymous name. It is a world 
 of broken hopes and empty dreams. It is a world of the anonymous.</td>
